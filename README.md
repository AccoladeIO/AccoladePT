# AccoladePT

***
**Requirements:**
* Go install the latest version for [Golang](https://golang.org/)
* Do some research around setting up your GOPATH and work space
* Todd McLeod offers top notch tutorials covering Go fundamentals including setting up your environment [Todd McLeod](https://www.youtube.com/user/toddmcleod)
* Install a decent IDE, something like [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) 
* Install Node.js, we won't be using it but it is a dependency for the workflow [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Download Bower, you will need this to pull Polymer components on demand [Bower.io](http://bower.io/)
* If you are wondering how you install Polymer, well this repo already contains Polymer 1.0 and its dependencies.

**Why Go?**
Well why not? I am not a programmer, so if I am forced to program the language needs to be coherent and the fundamentals need to be transparent. Go is exactly that. It is readable, even by someone like me. Go is also modern, meaning it doesn't carry the baggage of 10 billion half built, half working libraries wrapped in libraries. It feels like a green field - one supported by Google.

**Why Polymer?**
Again why not? I was looking at component frameworks and it came down to Google's Polymer and Facebook's React.js. Given that I think Facebook's UI/UX is rubbish, it makes sense to go with Google. Yes, Polymer is only bleeding edge compatible, but I don't care, especially for a prototype.

***
**Running AccoladePT.exe**
* This executable contains two main Go packages. The Http Server and the API. 
* When you run this .exe file go check localhost:8080 you will see the current application build.
* Use this for front end testing. You monitor back-end errors via the terminal logs. 

# Updates
* [05/03/2016] - This repo is currently being used to store some very basic implementations for the purpose of a demonstration.
